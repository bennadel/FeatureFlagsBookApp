# Feature Flags Book Playground

by [Ben Nadel][ben-nadel]

**STATUS: Work in Progress**

As a fun experiment, I wanted to build a small playground companion to my [Feature Flags Book][book]. This is a place where readers can log into a system and try creating feature flags and updating targeting rules to get a sense of how a feature flags / feature toggles system can be used.

## Change Log

* **2024, May 27**: Added a light-weight authentication workflow.
* **2024, May 23**: Created repository.
